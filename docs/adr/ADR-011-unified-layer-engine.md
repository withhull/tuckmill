# ADR-011: One unified layer engine for every model family

Status: **accepted** (2026-10-26). Extends ADR-005 (TuckCore behind
`InferenceBackend`) and ADR-007 (Metal ABI). Supersedes the per-family
forward passes (`forward.rs`/`gpu.rs` for dense Qwen3, `qwen35_forward.rs`
/`qwen35_gpu.rs` for Qwen3.5) once their migration gates pass.

## Context

Each model family has its own hand-written forward pass, on CPU and on
Metal, about 8,000 lines across the two families. Every cross-cutting
improvement (one command buffer per step, batched prefill, attention
rewrites, matrix-unit GEMM) had to be built per family. They drifted: the
Qwen3.5 attention and prefill work never reached dense Qwen3. The target
list (Llama 3.x, Gemma, Mistral, DeepSeek, gpt-oss, MoE) makes that cost
multiply. The product owner decided: one unified engine only.

## Decision

1. **Adapters describe, one engine executes.** An adapter resolves an
   artifact's metadata and tensor index into a typed `ModelGraph`:
   - the embedding, a list of layers, the final norm and the output head;
   - per layer: a pre-norm, a token **mixer** and an **FFN**, with residual
     wiring;
   - each tensor binding checked once for dtype and shape.
   An unknown architecture or block is a typed refusal that names the
   missing block. It is never approximated.
2. **Blocks are the only place model math lives.** Each block is
   implemented once, on the CPU oracle and on Metal:
   - mixers: `Attention` (GQA; optional Q/K norm; full or partial RoPE,
     NeoX or standard; optional sigmoid output gate) and `GatedDeltaNet`;
   - FFNs: `SwiGLU` now, `GeGLU` and `MoE` (routed + shared experts) as
     families need them;
   - norms: `RMSNorm` with the weight variants families use.
   Each block offers `decode` (one token) and `prefill` (a chunk) and
   declares its session state (KV planes, recurrent/convolution state)
   and scratch for the planner. A new family adds an adapter, and a new
   block only for genuinely new math.
3. **The engine owns everything cross-cutting, once:**
   - one command buffer per decode step and per prefill chunk;
   - chunked prefill, with logits for the last token only;
   - device-side greedy sampling;
   - session reset and cancellation at chunk/token boundaries;
   - preflight allocation from the graph (one plan function, ledger ==
     plan), checked per class against the admitted plan;
   - per-operator profiling;
   - weight access through one `WeightStore`: resident now, and the place
     Phase 2 streaming plugs in.
4. **One oracle per block, plus the old oracles as references.** The CPU
   engine executes the same `ModelGraph` with scalar f32 blocks. The
   existing per-family CPU oracles stay as independent references until
   the graph oracle reproduces them bit-for-bit, then retire.
5. **Same-profile execution is unchanged.** The graph *is* the artifact's
   computation: no block is substituted, dropped or approximated, and
   precision profiles stay declared and recorded (ADR-010).

## Migration (each step gated, nothing deleted before its gate)

1. Engine core plus the blocks Qwen3.5 needs. Qwen3.5 is served through
   the engine. Gate: identical greedy output and teacher-forced logits
   matching the current Qwen3.5 GPU path (same kernels, so bit-identical
   decode is expected) and the CPU oracle within registered tolerances.
   Then retire `qwen35_gpu.rs`'s model code.
2. Dense Qwen3 as a graph on the same blocks. Gate: its CPU oracle and
   registered llama.cpp envelopes, plus the recorded batch-size claims
   re-proven or explicitly superseded in `docs/claims.md`. Then retire
   `gpu.rs`/`forward.rs` model code.
3. New families are adapters (+ blocks): Llama 3.x, Gemma, Mistral, then
   MoE.

Performance work from now on (chunk-wide DeltaNet, batched attention,
fusions, GPU sampling, streaming) lands in engine blocks or the engine,
never in a family-specific path.

## Consequences

- One place to optimize: every gain reaches every family.
- The migration costs some performance work now (rebuilding today's
  Qwen3.5 speed on blocks). The bit-identical gate makes that safe.
- The CLI, worker protocol and planner contracts do not change; TuckCore
  still implements `InferenceBackend`.
